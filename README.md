[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

A workshop for R Markdown users who want to get more out of R Markdown (and friends). In this workshop, we will demystify how R Markdown works under the hood. You will learn practical tools and workflows to increase your efficiency and productivity using R Markdown (including RStudio IDE features, projects, parameterized reports, and templates), while learning how to use some extension packages along the way (flexdashboard, pkgdown, and distill). We assume that you have knit an R Markdown document before, but you don’t need to be an advanced R Markdown user to take this workshop.

The workshop materials in this repository are a *work in progress*. This means that the materials will be changing frequently as we rapidly iterate and explore variations to meet our needs. Stay tuned for an announcement on when you can sign up to attend this workshop when it is ready to be offered to the public!
