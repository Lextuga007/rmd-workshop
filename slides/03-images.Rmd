A simple markdown code line for linking to an image online. html can be used
too which can be useful if you need to resize the pictures.

<i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x" style="color: #fff;"></i>

# <center>Images - navigating folders</center>

--

## Same folder

```markdown
![](bakers_1.png)
```

???
Linking to an image in the same area as the .rmd file is straightforward, as is having a subfolder. 
--

## Sub folder

```markdown
![](img/bakers_2.png)
```

--

### Folder from subfolder from the main root

```markdown
![](../images/bakers_3.png)
```


???

But if the folder it up a level and down another then the pathway changes.

RMarkdown doesn't access the files in the project, only the files in its location.

Refresh on .RProj? Always use Projects.

The dot dot pathway finds the file but doesn't render in [xaringan slides](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/145).

# Markdown pathways to images

Open file `03-bakeoff-images.Rmd` from the folder `03-images/`

Together we will use markdown to link to an image:

1. In the same folder

1. In a subfolder

1. In a subfolder from the main root

_psst... we will be testing out the code from the previous slide!..._

???

Same folder
![](bakers_1.png)
Sub folder
![](img/bakers_2.png)
Folder from subfolder from the main root
![](../images/bakers_3.png)

Note that autofills. To force a prompt to autofill use `tab`

Also if Global Options/RMarkdown/Show output inline for all R Markdown... is ticked
the picture will automatically appear in the script. To remove untick but also 
requires a restart `Ctrl + Shift + F10`

![Alt text: picture of a sponge cake from a village competition](http://bit.ly/blue-ribbon)

???
Alternative text is useful for people who use screen readers but also helpful 
for when the image link breaks, you now get a description of what you should be 
seeing.

# <center>Alt Text</center>

## Markdown 

Between the [] brackets

```markdown
![Alt text: picture of a sponge cake from a village competition](http://bit.ly/blue-ribbon-sponge)
```

--

## HTML

Within the <> and space between sections

```markdown
<div id="bg">
  <img src="http://bit.ly/blue-ribbon-sponge" alt="Alt text: picture of a sponge cake from a village competition">
</div> 
```

---

# <center>Alt Text continued</center>

## knitr

Use `fig.alt=`

````
```{r fig.alt="Alt text: picture of a sponge cake from a village competition"}`r ''`
knitr::include_graphics("images/joy-of-fp/bakers_1.png")
```
````

???
> By default, if you do not provide the fig.alt chunk option, the text in the figure caption provided by the fig.cap chunk option will be used as the alt text. You do not have to use fig.cap to use fig.alt- you may use each chunk option in isolation, but they will also work together.
