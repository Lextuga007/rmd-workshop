1. Add a floating table of contents

1. Add a theme

`r emo::ji("yarn")` **Knit** to HTML to see the output.

Some may be familiar to the concept of parameters from SQL where code use in multiple
places later in the script are written at the top so they can be easily changed. 

This is a particular example of this 'hard coding' of parameters.

Change this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
yml_empty() %>% 
  yml_title("The Great British Bake Off") %>% 
  yml_output(html_document(toc = TRUE,
                           toc_float = TRUE,
                           theme = "flatly",
                           code_download = TRUE)) %>% 
  yml_params(
    series = '1'
  ) %>% 
  asis_yaml_output()
```

]

.pull-right[

To this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
yml_empty() %>% 
  yml_title("The Great British Bake Off") %>% 
  yml_output(html_document(toc = TRUE,
                           toc_float = TRUE,
                           theme = "flatly",
                           code_download = TRUE)) %>% 
  yml_params(
    series = '2'
  ) %>% 
  asis_yaml_output()

# Adding/running chunks

Together we:

1. Add chunks with button or:

   Ctrl + Alt + `i` (Windows/Linux)
   
   Command (or Cmd) `â` + Option (or Alt) `â¥` +  `i` (Mac)
   
1. Run chunks by:

   Run current chunk button (interactive)
   
   Knit button / run all chunks

???

Shortcut key to run a chunk Ctrl + Shift + Enter

Shortcuts for chunks can be amended or added in Tools/Modify Keyboard Shortcuts...

Echo (showing code) is default to TRUE. Setting to FALSE just returns the results, no code.

```{r eval=FALSE}`r ''`

Eval is short for evaluate and if set to FALSE stops the code from running. 
Good if the code is an example of broken code which would stop the report from 
running if set to TRUE (which is default).

[From RStudio lesson](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html):

FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. 
R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.

---

# results

.pull-left[

````
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}`r ''`
glimpse(ratings)
```
````

]

.pull-right[

```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
glimpse(ratings)
```

]

???

Note here the code has more than one control and they are separated by a comma.

[From RMarkdown tips](https://garthtarr.github.io/meatR/tips.html):

results = 'hide' hide the results of the chunk output (i.e. donât show them)
results = 'hold' hold the results of the chunk output until all commands in the 
chunk have been run

[On 'asis'](https://garrettgman.github.io/rmarkdown/authoring_rcodechunks.html)
Note the use of the results='asis' chunk option. This is required to ensure that
the raw table output isnât processed further by knitr. The kable function 
includes several options to control the maximum number of digits for numeric 
columns, alignment, etc (refer to the knitr package documentation for additional
details)

# message / warning



![](https://www.tidyverse.org/images/tidyverse_1.2.0/tidyverse_1-2-0_pkg_load.gif)

???

This is an example of a detailed message from {tidyverse} but what if you wanted 
to not print that message when a chunk was run?

---

# message / warning

.pull-left[

````
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}`r ''`
library(tidyverse)
```
````

]

.pull-right[

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Chunk option take-aways

+ Place between curly braces<br>`{r option=value}`

+ Multiple options separated by commas<br>`{r option1=value, option2=value}`

+ Careful! The `r` part is the **code engine** (other engines possible)

???

Such as sql which will require a database connection. Training and exercises available
through the NHS-R Community, [link here](https://philosopher-analyst.netlify.app/intro-r/nhsr-intro/11-sql-connection/)

# Chunk labels

.pull-left[

````
```{r peek, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}`r ''`
glimpse(ratings)
```
````

]

.pull-right[

+ Place between curly braces<br>`{r label}`

+ Separated options with commas<br>`{r label, option1=value}`

+ Careful! No duplicate chunk labels

    ````
    ```{r peek}`r ''`
    head(ratings)
    ```
    ````

    ```
    Error in parse_block(g[-1], g[1], params.src) :

Live code example with the peek chunk, knit then repeat the chunk either by copying
or using Ctrl + Alt + i for a new chunk and then typing head(ratings)

# A good chunk label

.pull-left[

### Good

`my-plot`

`myplot`

`myplot1`

`myplot-1`

`MY-PLOT`

]

.pull-right[

### Bad

`my_plot`

`my plot`

everything else!

# The setup chunk



.pull-left[

````
```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,   
  comment = "#>", 
  out.width = "100%" 
)
```
````

]

.pull-right[

+ A special chunk label: `setup`

+ Typically #1

+ All following chunks will use these options (i.e., sets global chunk options)

+ **Tip**: set `include=FALSE`

+ You can (and should) use individual chunk options too

# Adding a setup chunk

We do this together:

1. Add `fig.path = "figs/"` as a knitr code chunk option for a single plot (watch what happens if we don't include the backslash!)

1. Knit and behold


???
Copy the fig.path = "figs/" and paste into the chunk settings for the first chart.
When this is run there is noticeably change to the report but a folder appears, called
figs and in there is `unnamed-chunk-2-1.png`.

If fig.path = "figs" is used instead the chart is not saved into a folder but in the main
area and the name is a concatenation of figs and the default `figsunnamed-chunk-2-1.png`

# Your turn

Customize this report.

1. Label the code chunks with plots.

1. Add your setup chunk. 

1. Use the RStudio outline pane; rejoice!

1. Build a [graphical user interface](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/params-knit.html#the-interactive-user-interface) for parameters. 

__If this was easy,__ try adding a parameter for color palette and add in a package like [wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) &mdash; use the parameter in our ggplot2 code.
