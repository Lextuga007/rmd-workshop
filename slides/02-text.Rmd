Text is in Markdown code - people might be familiar with note taking apps that use
Markdown. Allows for formatting of text to be through code.

Make sure that there is a space between the hashes and the text as it won't be picked up otherwise.

Using markdown language we format text as bold or italics. 

You might notice that underline isn't covered, it's not included in markdown but can be done using html. However, it's not accessible for everyone so is best avoided.

Different versions of RStudio have different buttons.

As of [RStudio version 1.4](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-v1-4-preview-visual-markdown-editing/)
there is now Visual Markdown Editing, located in the Editor pane (when an RMarkdown script is open)

The introduction to R training uses the code (@) but this doesn't work necessarily in {xaringan} slides.

Copying this into MS Teams loses the formatting so the space might get lost.
