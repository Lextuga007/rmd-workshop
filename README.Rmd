## Acknowledgement

This repository has been cloned from the [original](https://github.com/rstudio-education/communicate-rmd-workshop) RStudio Education site and the files relating to the Netlify publishing have been removed. This was originally a full-day workshop created and delivered by Alison Hill to the Young Statisticians Conference 2019. The slides are published on [Netlify](https://ysc-rmarkdown.netlify.app/) with its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ysc2019-workshop) for materials. I found this resource through [Alison's blog](https://www.apreshill.com/talk/2019-ysc-workshop/).
